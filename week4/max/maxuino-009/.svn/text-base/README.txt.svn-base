The package uses Max's built-in serial object to implement OpenSoundConrol (http://opensoundcontrol.org) style communication to/from the arduino-compatable hardware.  Download the full package here:

http://www.maxuino.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/maxuino-008.zip

This package has been tested with Max 5.1.3, Arduino 018, and the following hardware:

    * Adruino Diecimila
    * Arduino Mega
    * Teensy 2.0
    * Teensy++ 2.0

To use it, you must:

   1. Install Arduino 018 IDE or later (For more on Arduino, go to http://arduino.cc)
   2. Install Max 5.1.3 or later (For more info on Max, go to http://cycling74.com/products/maxmspjitter/)
   3. Replace the "Firmata" library included with Arduino 018 with this folder:
      http://maxuino.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/firmata.tar.gz

      To do this, open the application package and replace this folder with the the Firmata folder from the above link:
      /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/libraries/Firmata
      [this should be fixed in Arduino 019]
   4. Load the "StandardFirmata" sketch onto your arduino (under File>Examples>Firmata>StandardFirmata)
   5. Install "OSC-route" Max external from CNMAT (see http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/downloads)
   6. Connect your arduino hardware, and open the patch "maxuino_test.maxpat"

The package includes the following:

maxuino_test.maxpat: the center piece test patch
maxuino-Apin-gui.maxpat: a GUI bpatcher for analog pins
maxuino-Dpin-gui.maxpat: a GUI bpatcher for digital pins
maxuino-gui.maxpat: a GUI abstraction for all inputs and outputs
maxuino-hardware.txt: a max collection that specifies the pin configurations of different arduino hardware implementations
maxuino.js: a javascript that communicates with Max's serial object
maxuino.maxpat: an abstraction that contains the above javascript

patcher history
v.008 major redisign of GUI, major improvement of communication with serial object (a .js does it all now, and packs bytes for efficiency)

v.007 bug fix and some cleanup including an interface change, also added servo support

v.006 adjusted for Firmata v2.1

v.005 adjusted for Firmata v2

v.003 reworked port selection, now by device name (for windows...)

v.002 added numbers for port selection

v.01 first release
